    <h1>Additional Details for <code>TRAPShield: Real-Time APT File Theft Defense with Multi-Domain Behavioral Characterization and Transparent Decoy Redirection</code></h1>

	<p><strong>TRAPShield</strong> presents an innovative defense framework against Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) file theft attacks. Its key contributions include:</p>
	  <ol class="roman">
		<li>
		  <strong>TRAPShield</strong> monitors and classifies sensitive file access behaviors on potentially compromised endpoints, and integrates a decoy-based deception mechanism to safeguard critical data assets and track attack activities. It establishes a minimum defense boundary and avoids heavy workload of full-cycle detection, eliminating the risk of data leakage caused by unavoidable false negatives in early-stage threat identification.
		</li>
		<li>
		  We design an effective malicious sensitive file access behavior identification approach. By maintaining a limited window of detailed historical behavioral events, <strong>TRAPShield</strong> extracts multi-domain, multi-granularity features to generate threat scores for each file access attempt. Combined with an adaptive process-level identity verification mechanism, it can comprehensively identify malicious theft behaviors targeting sensitive files.
		</li>
		<li>
		  We design an attacker-transparent redirection mechanism to counter malicious file access attempts. Specifically, we pre-construct a decoy file library covering diverse topics and categories. For each detected sensitive file theft behavior, <strong>TRAPShield</strong> selects a decoy counterpart for the target file and redirects access to the deceptive decoy file through interception techniques, which can effectively prevent real sensitive data from being stolen. Based on the deception strategy, we can continuously track APT attack activities without damaging any critical files, thereby reconstructing complete attack scenarios to uncover adversarial tactics and intentions.
		</li>
		<li>
		  We conduct extensive evaluations three groups of datasets constructed from large-scale real-world APT reports, covering diverse APT file theft modalities and advanced attack scenarios. <strong>TRAPShield</strong> achieves F<sub>1</sub> scores above 90.95% in detecting malicious access to sensitive files, and only applying identity authentication for less than 5% of accesses, it can achieve zero false negatives. The average detection and redirection latency is 0.125&nbsp;ms, enabling real-time file protection in real-world environments. Furthermore, decoy-triggered events enable comprehensive tracking full attack chain and extracting multi-stage malware samples, facilitating further forensic analysis and threat attribution.
		</li>

    <h2>A. Preliminary Study on Quantitative Analysis of Multi-domain Behaviors</h2>
    <p>
      The case analyses reveal clear behavioral distinctions between benign and malicious sensitive file accesses. We leverage <em>Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</em> to quantify these differences.
      The null hypothesis \( H_0 \) posits no significant difference exists in behavioral features between the two access categories. We assess six feature domains: ① specific file operation frequencies, ② registry operation frequencies, ③ TCP/IP network event counts, ④ specific file type access frequency and diversity, ⑤ statistical characteristics of network packet lengths, and ⑥ <em>N-gram</em> patterns of file I/O actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      We perform <em>one-way ANOVA</em> to determine whether to reject \( H_0 \). Table <span class="mono">avg_pvalue_by_domain</span> presents the average $p$-values across the six feature domains. A significance threshold of \( \alpha = 0.05 \) is used, $p$-values below this indicate statistical significance. As can be seen from the table, all domains yield $p$-values well below 0.05, confirming that benign and malicious accesses exhibit statistically behavioral differences. For instance, the 4-gram pattern <code>FileIOFileCreate_FileIORead_FileIORead_FileIORead</code> yields a $p$-value of $2.54\mathrm{e}{-14}$, and the entropy of packet lengths yields $8.11\mathrm{e}{-70}$, both far less than 0.05. It indicates that multi-domain historical behavioral features are highly discriminative for identifying benign and malicious sensitive file accesses.

    </div>

    <h2>B. Implementation Details of <code>TRAPShield</code></h2>
    <p>
      We set the length of the historical time window to 60 seconds. The $n$ value of file I/O <em>N-gram</em> patterns is 3 and 4. We adopt the RandomForest ensemble classifier for malicious sensitive file access behavior identification. The number of base estimators is set between 30 and 200, with a maximum tree depth of 10. These hyperparameter settings are chosen to mitigate noise and enhance the generalization in high-dimensional feature spaces. For data re-balancing, we use 3 neighbors in the ENN component and set the <code>kind_sel</code> to <code>mode</code>. We leverage the <code>ChatGPT-4o</code> LLM to construct the decoy file library. The weights $w_1$ and $w_2$ of the two similarity metrics for candidate decoys selection are set to 0.7 and 0.3. For attack scenario reconstruction, the number of traced parent hops is set to 3. These hyperparameter settings yield the best performance on our development sets.
    </p>

    <h2>C. Multi-Domain, Multi-granularity Behavioral Feature Visualization Analysis</h2>
      <h3>1. Feature Importance Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        We further display the importance of specific features through visualization to improve the interpretability of <code>TRAPShield</code> for security forensic analysts. We extract feature importance scores from the RandomForest classifier trained on all five APT file theft datasets. For each attack scenario, the feature importance scores are normalized by <em>min-max</em> scaling, and then averaged across all datasets.
      </p>

      <figure style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="figs/plan3_normavgscores_heatmap.png" alt="Heatmap of top-20 features importance" style="max-width:50%; height:auto;"/>
        <figcaption>Heatmap of the top-20 features with the highest average normalized importance scores across datasets <code>M-1</code> to <code>B-2</code>.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As observed, features related to registry operations including <em>open</em>, <em>query</em>, and <em>modification</em> behaviors at both the process and parent-process levels play a critical role in identifying sensitive file theft activities. Additionally, the file I/O behaviors related to the file <em>opening</em>, <em>writing</em>, and <em>directory enumeration</em> at the process and global granularities are consistently important. Furthermore, statistical features capturing process interactions with specific file types, including <em>ini</em>, <em>xlsx</em>, and <em>ppt</em>, are also highly indicative across multiple datasets.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Feature Discrimination Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        We further evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-domain, multi-granularity features extracted by 
        <code>TRAPShield</code> through t-SNE visualization. Specifically, for each sensitive file-access behavior, we 
        standardize the extracted 570-dimensional feature vector, reduce its dimensionality to 50 using PCA, and then 
        project it into a two-dimensional embedding space using t-SNE.
      </p>

      <figure style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="figs/tsne-6.png" 
            alt="t-SNE visualization of multi-domain multi-granularity features" 
            style="max-width:68%; height:auto; border:1px solid #ddd; border-radius:4px; padding:4px;"/>
        <figcaption>

          APT file-theft scenarios via t-SNE projection.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>
  Figures (a)–(c) illustrate the distributions of benign and malicious sensitive file access behaviors in scenarios 
  <code>M-1</code> and <code>M-2</code>, <code>B-1</code> and <code>B-2</code>, and <code>C-1</code>, where malicious 
  accesses are highlighted in red. The features corresponding to APT attackers’ file theft activities—including 
  periodic manual theft, automated scheduled theft, and covert theft via process injection—are clearly separable 
  from benign accesses in the embedding space. Malicious accesses form clustered and continuous band-shaped 
  structures, reflecting the temporal evolution and sequential continuity of file access behaviors while maintaining 
  clear boundaries from benign clusters. These findings demonstrate that the multi-domain and multi-granularity 
  behavioral features extracted by <code>TRAPShield</code>—covering file and registry operation patterns, statistical 
  network activity measures, and file I/O sequence characteristics—are highly effective in distinguishing malicious 
  file theft attacks from normal access behaviors.
</p>

<p>
  Figures (d)–(f) further visualize the feature distributions of different processes accessing sensitive files in datasets
  <code>M-2</code>, <code>B-2</code>, and <code>C-1</code>. Each process is color-coded.
  In addition to malicious file-theft processes, normal processes are also included, such as
  the Windows file manager (<em>explorer.exe</em>); file-editing applications (e.g.,
  <em>WINWORD.EXE</em>, <em>wps.exe</em>, <em>notepad.exe</em>); file-synchronization processes
  (e.g., <em>wpscloudsvr.exe</em>); applications with file-transfer capabilities (e.g.,
  <em>mailmaster.exe</em>, <em>WeChat.exe</em>, <em>firefox.exe</em>); and system processes
  (<em>svchost.exe</em>). These applications’ file-access behaviors exhibit strong intra-class
  compactness and inter-class separability, indicating that the features extracted by
  <code>TRAPShield</code> not only effectively distinguish malicious and benign sensitive
  file-access processes, but also capture discriminative characteristics across different
  application categories.
</p>

	<h2>D. Runtime Overheads of Malicious Sensitive File Access Behavior Identification</h2>
    <p>
      The malicious sensitive file access behavior identification module of <code>TRAPShield</code> consists of the offline processing phase and online prediction phase. Table <span class="mono">offline_online_time</span> reports the runtime overheads for both phases across different APT file theft datasets. Offline operations include data pre-processing, class re-balancing, classifier training, and authentication-based threshold selection. The duration of each step ranges from seconds to minutes, with the class re-balancing stage being the most time-consuming, averaging approximately 6.5 <em>minutes</em>. For the online prediction phase, the average time required to profile and classify each sensitive file access behavior is below 0.26 <em>ms</em> across all datasets. As evaluated in Section <span class="mono">IV.D</span>, the average overhead of the attacker-transparent decoy file redirection module is within 0.125 <em>ms</em>. These results demonstrate that <code>TRAPShield</code> supports real-time detection and defense of sensitive file theft behaviors.

	<h2>E. Further Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Decoy Files Redirection</h2>

	  <p>
		In this section, we further evaluate the effectiveness of
		<code>TRAPShield</code>'s attacker-transparent decoy file redirection module.
		We selected 5 popular office applications, including
		<code>Word</code>, <code>PowerPoint</code>, <code>EXCEL</code>, <code>notepad</code>,
		and <code>Adobe</code>, which are easily abused by attackers as injection targets.
		We inject the DLL into the running application processes and enable the decoy file
		redirection function. Then we build automated scripts to drive each application to
		iteratively perform <em>file opening</em>, <em>reading</em>, and <em>closing</em>
		operations on files of corresponding type, repeating this process five times for the
		675 sensitive files.
	  </p>

	  <figure id="application_filetype_cdf" style="text-align:center;">
		<img src="figs/application_filetype_cdf_access_time_filtered_2ms_V3.png"
			 alt="CDFs of decoy file redirection time of specific file types accessed by different applications."
			 style="max-width:50%; height:auto;">
		<figcaption>
		  CDFs of decoy file redirection time of specific file types accessed by different applications.
		</figcaption>
	  </figure>

	  <p>
		The above figure shows the cumulative distribution
		functions (CDFs) of the interception and redirection time cost, grouped by file type and application.
		It can be seen that for the 5 selected office applications, over 90% of hijacking and redirection
		operations incur a latency below 0.2&nbsp;<em>ms</em>. In general,
		<code>TRAPShield</code>'s transparent decoy file redirection mechanism remains imperceptible
		to attackers and does not noticeably affect normal users performing file operations
		with daily office applications.
	  </p>

  <p>
    We further evaluated the runtime overheads of the minifilter-driver-based decoy file
    redirection mechanism, which serves as a fallback when <code>Detours</code>-based DLL
    injection into the target attack process fails (a condition that did not occur during
    our evaluation). The following figure shows the CDFs of
    redirection time cost measured for different file types. The mean latency ranges from 0.0128 to 0.0148&nbsp;<em>ms</em>, and nearly all
    redirections complete within 0.2&nbsp;<em>ms</em>. Compared with the DLL-injection-based
    decoy redirection, the driver-based approach exhibits significantly higher efficiency,
    although it introduces additional kernel–user space communication overhead. To minimize
    system impact while maintaining fine-grained process control and redirection reliability,
    <code>TRAPShield</code> adopts a <em>hybrid redirection strategy</em> that seamlessly
    combines both approaches.

    <p>
      During the endpoint behavior log collection and storage process, <code>TRAPShield</code> retains only a short window of recent full logs while applying simplification techniques to the larger body of historical logs. The decoy triggering-based attack tracking and reconstruction module traces simplified historical event logs to perform global association analysis. Tables <span class="mono">log_storage_compression</span> and <span class="mono">log_storage_compression2</span> present the disk space consumption before and after simplification for each APT file theft dataset, along with the memory usage required to load the full historical logs. The evaluation environment is a Windows 10 64-bit virtual machine with 12GB of RAM and 100GB of storage. The corresponding simplification ratios are also reported. As shown, simplified storage of historical logs reduces disk usage by more than 97% and memory consumption by over 92%. In all scenarios, the full simplified logs occupy less than 200 MB of disk space, and loading the entire set of summarized historical logs for correlation analysis requires less than 300 MB of memory. These results demonstrate that <code>TRAPShield</code> supports efficient attack activities tracking and scenario reconstruction with modest computational resources.
